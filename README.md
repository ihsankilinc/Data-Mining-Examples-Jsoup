# Data-Mining-Examples-Jsoup
This repository contains 3 different examples of **data extracting from an html page using jsoup**. I created this before for a Turkish News Website and can't share the cpanel pages because of legal reasons. 

**CaptionGenerator** extracts data from shared news page and generates a list of shared news topics for the last day in alphabetical order. Plus ordering them by views in another section.

**CaptionGeneratorMonthly** generates monthly shared news for a single user and orders them by view. Completely same logic with CaptionGenerator but it generates the user's most viewed news too.

**CaptionTakerPlagiarism** extracts chosen range of news from the shared news panel. It will visit all of those news page and generate their plagiarism rates.
